# Smart Visitor Management System üì±

A cross-platform visitor management app built with Flutter. This project is a comprehensive example of how to build a scalable and maintainable application using a clean **MVVM architecture**, **Riverpod** for state management, and a **Feature-First** folder structure.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Dual Visitor Modes:** Register walk-in visitors or check-in pre-approved guests from a JSON-based list.
* **Photo Capture:** Uses `image_picker` to capture a visitor's photo from the camera during registration.
* **QR Code Pass:** Generates a unique visitor pass with a scannable QR code (`qr_flutter`) upon successful check-in.
* **Visitor Logging:** Maintains a persistent log of all checked-in visitors and their check-in/check-out times.
* **Clean State Management:** All app state is managed by Riverpod `Notifiers`, providing a single, reliable source of truth.

## üèóÔ∏è Architecture & Tech Stack

This app was built to demonstrate modern Flutter development practices. The architecture is the main focus.

* **Flutter:** Cross-platform UI toolkit for building natively compiled applications.
* **Riverpod:** A modern, compile-safe state management library that's independent of the widget tree.
* **MVVM (Model-View-ViewModel):**
    * **Model:** The data layer (`visitor_model.dart`), responsible for data structure and JSON parsing.
    * **View:** The UI (`home_screen.dart`, etc.), converted to `ConsumerWidgets` that react to state changes.
    * **ViewModel:** The logic layer, implemented as Riverpod `Notifiers` (`visitor_provider.dart`), which manages the state and business logic.
* **Feature-First Structure:** Code is organized by feature (e.g., `features/visitors`) rather than by type (e.g., `views/`, `models/`), making the project easier to scale.
* **Repository Pattern:** A `VisitorRepository` class is used to abstract the data source. This makes it easy to swap the local JSON data for a real backend API in the future.
* **JSON Data:** The app simulates fetching data from a remote server by loading and parsing local `.json` files from the `assets` folder.
